# Cloud Native Java with Spring Boot (CNCF Aarhus, April 2024)

## Stack

* Java 22
* Spring Boot 3.3
* Grafana OSS

## Description

Java is a modern and powerful technology stack, making it an excellent choice for developing cloud-native applications. Spring, built on top of Java, offers a broad ecosystem of frameworks and libraries, prioritizing developer experience, production readiness, and cloud integrations.

In this session, Thomas will delve into common patterns and best practices for building cloud-native applications with Java. You will learn how to optimize the developer experience using Spring Boot, leveraging features like live reload and seamless integration with Testcontainers and Docker Compose to streamline development and testing processes.

Next, you will discover how to integrate applications with large language models and vector stores, bringing Generative AI capabilities into Java through Spring AI and LangChain4j. Following this, Thomas will demonstrate how to prepare applications for production by compiling Java into native executables with GraalVM, resulting in instant startup times and reduced memory consumption.

Finally, you will see how to containerize Java applications using Buildpacks, fine-tune observability with Micrometer and OpenTelemetry, and configure serverless deployments on Kubernetes with Knative.
